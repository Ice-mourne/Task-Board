# Task Board - Obsidian Plugin

> Inspired from [CardBoard]() by []().

An Obsidian plugin to see all your task in a much more efficient Kanban Board format. Easily manage your tasks throught your vault.


## Motivation for the Project

Earlier i was using the Kanban Plugin by , but the issue i found in that is, i like to create Tasks throughout my vault and not just a single file. Hence i was struggling to manage my tasks and have proper workflow for any projects. But later i came across the plugin CardBoard by . It was going great and i really liked this plugin over Kanban. I was using this from last few months, but i found few issues in the plugin such as layout size handling, etc. Hence i started this project to resolve those issues as well as integrate more functionalties to get best of both the plugins.
I coldnt able to go with the older project of Cardboard, as i dont understand the elm project structure.
